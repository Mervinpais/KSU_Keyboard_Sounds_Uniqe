# KSU - Keyboard sounds UNIQE

_"Hey what instrument you play?"_

"Keyboard"

### *keyboard clicking sounds intensify*

But yeah this is an OSU-Like app, but for keyboard only :)

Also Dean (OSU's Creator/Developer) if you want to  take this  down, uhh i can change the name to stop ripping osu if so, or any other issue :|

KSU uses .ksu file format, here is an example of the format;

```ksu
O:/Path/To/WAV!/File/Here/without/any/quotes
0-a
1-b
0.75-c
1.25-d
```

- The '_-_' acts just as , in CSV files

There is no editor as per V0.0.1 but yeah :/ its all manual for now
